    "The widget generated by this notebook facilitates the creation of a dataset suitable for addressing a collision avoidance problem on Jetracer robot. [Jetbot robot code](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot) is used as a reference for creating the widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we take to avoiding collisions is to create a virtual \"safety bubble\" around the robot. Within this safety bubble, the robot is able to spin in a circle without hitting any objects. Only a sensor is used: the camera mounted on Jetracer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two scenarios can be distinguished:\n",
    "- When the robot's \"safety bubble\" is breached. This scenario will be labeled as `blocked`;\n",
    "- When the robot's \"safety bubble\" is not breached. This scenario will be labeled as `free`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The steering angle of the JetRacer is limited**. This is an important detail to remember when you're trying to estimate whether the robot's safety bubble is violated or not."
