    "# Collision Avoidance - Live Demo\n",
    "In this notebook we'll use the model we trained to detect whether the robot is free or blocked to enable a collision avoidance behavior on the robot. It is assumed that the optimized neural network has already been created and loaded into the Jupyter Lab file browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showcases the implementation of a strategy that enables the JetRacer to reverse when an obstacle is too close and cannot be circumvented by simply steering. This capability was achieved by mounting an ultrasonic distance sensor on the JetRacer. In order to achieve smooth maneuver transitions and maintain a consistent speed during maneuvering, a PID controller was integrated for speed regulation. This controller utilizes an IR speed sensor mounted on the JetRacer. Speed and distance values are computed by an ESP-32 microcontroller connected to the sensors. These measurements are transmitted to the JetRacer via serial communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The employed PID controller is the one implemented in the [Discrete-TimePID](https://github.com/chentyra/Discrete-TimePID) repository.\n",
